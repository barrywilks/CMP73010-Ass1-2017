1.Under your repository name, click “Pull requests”
2.In the “Pull Requests” list, click the pull request you'd like to merge.
3.Depending on the merge options enabled for your repository, you can:
Merge all of the commits into the base branch by clicking Merge pull request. If the Merge pull request option is not shown, then click the merge drop down menu and select Create a merge commit.
Squash the commits into one commit by clicking the merge drop down menu, selecting Squash and merge and then clicking the Squash and merge button.
Rebase the commits individually onto the base branch by clicking the merge drop down menu, selecting Rebase and merge and then clicking the Rebase and merge button.
4.If you clicked Merge pull request or Squash and merge in step 3, type a commit message, or accept the default message. Under the commit message box, click Confirm merge or Confirm squash and merge.
5.If you clicked Rebase and merge in step 3, click Confirm rebase and merge.
6.Optionally, delete the branch. This keeps the list of branches in your repository tidy.
